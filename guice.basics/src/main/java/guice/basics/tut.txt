Guice is an Open source framework for the JAVA Platform. and it supports dependency injection.
Dependency Injection supports the Inversion of control principle that the object should be injected rather than being created.
The object must be passed as the parameter to the class or function.

Injector is used to provide the instance of an interface i.e the classes implemented by the interfaces.
Now the interface can be implemented by many classes. So to specify which class should be used , the GUICe has abstract module class
i.e AbstractModule.class which have the abstract class configure method in which we have to bind the interface with the class.

How Guice builds object .?

When Type A is requested (either through Injector.createInstance or through requesting Type B which has dependency on type A)
 it does two things :-

1.) Consults binding to resolve the concrete type i.e through AppModule - configure method and bind function.
2.) Build Object of that type.

-> Now if Type A is an interface then we must have binding like in AppModule.class. 
-> If Type A is a base class then we can bind like the subClass i.e child class. Useful in Factory Pattern.

How to inject Constant Dependencies.?
-> If we are having any private data members to be used in a class. then it can be injected directly through the constructor and binding
it in the appModule. Hence bind(String.class).toInstance("Red") is used in this case.

Here the problem is , If we are having multiple constructors with the same definition then we have to use the Annotations.

How To create Annotations
-> create an annotation with @annotation and just passed it before the parameter in the constructor.
	While creating the annotation dont forget to give the @BindingAnnotation.
	Then just bind it in the AppModule , and bind it with .AnnotatedWith() 
	e.g - bind(String.class).annotatedWith(ColorValue.class).toInstance("Yellow");

OBJECT GRAPH - It is the flow of how the dependencies are injected .

THere is something called MEthod Injection which is very similar to the Constructor Injection
